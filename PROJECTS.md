## 360ReviewVR
#### Founder, Full Stack Software Engineer, System architect
##### October 2016 - February 2018

Development of the working prototype for own startup project. 360ReviewVR — is a version control system for 360˚ video production. It intended to be delivered using SaaS (Software as a Service) business model. 

The software part was created using combination of:
- PHP (custom code over WordPress CMS as a quick start basement)
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) module for processing of video and sound files with CLI
- JavaScript / HTML / CSS / Bootstrap package for frontend
- JS lib [Forge.JS by GoPro](https://forgejs.org/) for playing 360˚ video with Ambisonic spatial sound. 

The system prototype provides:
- access only for registered users with the distribution of opportunities by roles in user projects;
- flexible system of user roles within each project separately;
- setting the required number of stages of the workflow for the project;
- 360˚ video's version tree;
- adding working versions of video and sound for the project:
  - uploading and processing 360˚ video,
  - uploading audio only leads to automatic creation of the new video version based on the latest with the sound track replaced by the uploaded one (e.g. replacing stereo draft with ambisonic);
- 360˚ video player with display format switching according to popular platforms (YouTube, Facebook, FB news feed, GoProVR, Vimeo etc.);
- tagging data, statuses and indication of the video review result;
- quick search by versions (filtering by status + query);
- comments with interactive objects (e.g. link to particular timecode with viewpoint settings for the video player);
- the process of approving the version by the participants in the process with the preservation of a status change history.
